## About me
Please enjoy my planet.Mars rover.Rover kata written in Java.
My coding journey began 10 months ago after switching careers.
I went through a 6 month intensive bootcamp before joining the FMA at MYOB in February.
I have been learning Java code since February, so a total of four months.
This is my first code presentation.
